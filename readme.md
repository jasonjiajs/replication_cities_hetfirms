# replication_cities_hetfirms

This project aims to replicate a few graphs and statistics from ['Cities, Heterogeneous Firms, and Trade' (2021)](https://github.com/jasonjiajs/replication_cities_hetfirms/blob/master/data/paper/Cities_Productivity_Trade_20230302.pdf), in both Python and Stata.

## Folder directory

- `code`: Python (Jupyter Notebook) and Stata code.
- `data`: Data used for analysis and a copy of the paper.
- `memo`: Memo with graphs and statistics. You can import `figure_replication_cities_hetfirms_trade_memo_20230304.zip` into Overleaf to quickly load the project.
- `output`: Graphs and statistics produced by the code.
- `.gitignore`: Note that one particular dataset, `data/EC1200A1.dat`, is too large to be saved in GitHub. It is only available in Dropbox.
